# README

This repo hosts the code for a demo project to demonstrate my skills in 

Ruby on Rails, postgresql, Jquery and bootstrap. I would add minitest, jenkins and AWS but this was created in a short amount of time.

Currently, Heroku (the hosting website for this code's app) does not support cookies at the subdomain level, so logging in and out will not work; though it will on a normal hosted website.

See below for a demonstration of the login and logout user "happy" path, in the mobile screen format.
